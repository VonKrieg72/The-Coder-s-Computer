## Text Editor

A text editor is software that you can either download onto your computer, or have access to online. Text editors enable you to write, organize, and manage text, in particular, the text that you write to build up a website. Some important features that you would want to make sure a text editor has are

***-Code completion***

***-Syntax highlighting*** 

***-A nice variety of themes***

***-The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them***

Code completion provides you with possible options or suggestions when you start typing, which minimizes the possibility for you to make typos or errors in your code. Syntax highlighting takes what you type and changes it to different colors to make them more noticeable, which makes it more easier for you to find typos and errors. For example, attributes, elements, and copy will all be different colors. Themes will enable you to change the color of the background in your text editor. Usually developers will choose darker background with bright letters, to reduce eye strain and fatigue. Extensions give you the ability to add on more features to yor text editor, like an upgrade. 

It's important to point out that all of your computers will come a text editor pre-installed. For example, Mac Os will come with a pre-installed text editor called "Text Edit", Windows Os will come with "Notepad", and Linux Os will come with different text editors installed, depending on your particular distribution. However, the text editors that come pre-installed on your computer won't come with the features mentioned earlier, such as code completion, syntax highlighting, a nice variety of themes, and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. This is important to point out, because with no code completion, it will be easier for you to make typos or errors, which you'll be responsible to edit on your own. 

Just to name a few third party text editors that you can download onto your computer, you can choose

***-Notepad (for Windows Os only)***

***-BB Edit, which has incorporated the former Text Wrangler into it (for Mac Os only)***

***-Visual Studio, which was made by Microsoft (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux)***

***-Atom, which is from Github (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux)***

***-Brackets, which is from Adobe (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux)***

You also have the option to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) instead of a regular text editor. IDEs have multiple different types of software in them. An IDE is a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger all in one. 

## The Command Line

A command Line, which is sometimes called a terminal is a text based interface to the system, which enables you to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard, in which feedback or a message will be given to you as a reply text. The command line in most cases will present you with a prompt, and as you type it will show up after the prompt. in most cases you'll be issuing the command.
